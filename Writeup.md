# Compare and contrast plots

## Uma's Plots

1. Plot 1
This is box plot to determine if there is any pattern amongst age of heart attack with survival. Based on the plot, it appears that the mean age of people who did not survive after a year were younger.
2. Plot 2
The second stacked bar plot compares the different heart contractility factors with survival. It appears that patient who did not survive have poor contratility factors. However, the disadvantage of this plot is that we cannot determine just by looking which is the acceptable range for a given variable. For example,Fractional shorteneing appears less for pateints who are dead, but for this variable lower numbers indicates more diseased heart.
3. Plot3
The scatter plot compared age of heart attack with EPSS for patients who are alive or dead within one year. No specific pattern was seen indicates that it does not affect mortality.
4. Plot4
The scatter plot compares age of heart attack with wall motion index. We see a pattern of value 1 for most patients who did not survive beyond one year.
5. Plot 5
The box plot compares the age of heart attack with pericardial effusion. It does not appear that presence of pericardial effusion has an effect on age of heart attack.
6. Plot 6
The scatter plot compares the presence of pericardial effusion on the contractility of the heart.Again no specific pattern was seen.

While looking these plots we must keep in mind that there is missing data distributed unevenly among the attributes.

## Ven's Plots

1. Plot 1
The scatter plot with the age of heart attack with LVDD shows that there is no specific pattern in these attributes among patients who are alive or dead.The markers should be of different contrast colors so that visualization would be easier.

2. Plot 2
The bar graph is a poor method to visualize age of heart attack with LVDD. It does not give any idea about how the variables are related. Most of the values of age of heart attack are hidden behind the LVDD data.The scatter plot is a better way to visualize this data.

## Importance of visualization of data 
Data visualization is very important as it gives more meaning to the data. We can compare and constrast multiple attributes of the data and look for patterns if any. Just doing mathematical calculations on the data does not give any idea how how the values are related. Visualization of data makes it easier.
